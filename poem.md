# Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll

---

Twas brillig and the slithy toves,
	did gire and wobble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves
	and the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite the claws that catch
beware the jub jub bird and shun the frumious bandersnatch

He took his vorpal sword in hand
Long time the maxome foe he sought--
so rested he by the tum tum tree

And stood awhile in in thought.
